As a client requested, the customer website needed to support the PayPal method as one of payment. Firstly, I reviewed the PayPal official document and investigate the current system how to apply it. It was decided to use PayPal's smart button through team meetings because it was the simplest way. 

- Modified current system JavaScript code to apply Smart button 
- Modified payment handling process code in the current system in order to process the result of payment into the system (Payment process controller)
- Modified current UI on customer website 
- After PayPal integrated, the back office and financial report were required to modified for PayPal.

### Tech Stack

- Java, Spring MVC
- T-SQL 
- JavaScript, JQuery, jsp, zk framework  

### Reference
- [PayPal Docs](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/business/checkout/set-up-standard-payments/)
