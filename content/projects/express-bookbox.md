This is a personal project to show book information stored in the database. I used Swagger for API documentation. The purpose of this project is to learn Node.js and Express as back-end code. 

### Tech stack

- Node.js (Express)
- PostgreSQL

For front-end part, I used React.js and the code was commit to different repository.
