A new interface had to be applied to one type of existing system reporting. The previous reporting system was managing data by connecting to 3rd database. The new interface is to communicate with 3rd party REST API interface. 

### Planing 

- Review the API document and plan to implement to existing system
- Consider exception cases - how to manage each exception 
- Create flow chart 

### Implementation

- Java 8, tomcat 8 
- Used Apache `HttpClient` 
- `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`
